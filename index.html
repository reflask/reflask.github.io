  <h1>Welcome to Project: Conservation of Plastic!</h1>
  <p>Project: Conservation of Plastic is a new way of saving plastic from hurting our city and our planet. It is based on tracking how many times refills and will provide reward points, which can be used for getting rewards.
  You can even compete globally or just with friends to see who can fill up the most bottles
